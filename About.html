<h1> INTRODUCTION</h1>
<p>When the Hawaiian Islands were first studied by ornithologists in the
nineteenth century, they were a bird paradise. The forests abounded with
many of the most unusual birds known to the world—some with enormous
sickle-shaped bills, some resembling parrots, a goose that spent most of
its life on barren lava flows, a tiny flightless rail, and a sea bird
that nested within the vents of the active volcanoes. Most of these
island birds were found nowhere else in the world.</p>

<p>Today many of the original island species are extinct, while others are
barely managing to hold their own. With more and more land being cleared
for agriculture and homesites, virgin forests here are becoming scarce.
Thus, protected areas like Hawaii Volcanoes and Haleakala National Parks
take on great significance as reserves where the native birds will
continue to survive. If you wish to learn about Hawaiian birdlife, you
will certainly want to spend some time in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park
and visit Haleakala National Park on the island of Maui. This booklet is
meant to be an aid to your trips in the field.<br></p>

       <h4>   OTHER BIRDS</h4>
<i> Accidentals</i><br>

From time to time various sea and other birds passing over the island or
blown inland during a storm may be observed in either park. In recent
years such accidentals have included:

  Red-footed booby (_Sula sula_): one record, Kilauea (1959).
  Peregrine falcon (_Falco peregrinus_): seen at Kilauea during 1961.
  Red phalarope (_Phalaropus fulicarius_): one record, Kilauea (1949).
  Gray-backed tern (_Sterna lunata_): one record, Kilauea (1959).<br>


                          <i> Formerly Recorded</i><br>

Several native birds that were formerly found within the park have not
been recorded in recent years. They include:

Hawaiian crow (_Corvus tropicus_): This, the only crow here and endemic
to the Island of Hawaii, formerly occurred within the park. One recent
Kilauea record (1940).

Akepa (_Loxops coccinea_): A tiny (4½″) bird. _Male_: Red-orange with no
white markings. _Female_: Green above and yellow below. Still occurs in
the koa forests northeast of the Mauna Loa Strip. Last park record was
over 20 years ago.

Akiapolaau (_Hemignathus wilsoni_): 5½″. Like the amakihi but with a
long, curved upper mandible overlapping the short straight lower bill.
Used to be a permanent resident of the koa kipukas along the Mauna Loa
Strip, but has not been observed within the park for several years.

Parrot-billed koa finch (_Pseudonestor xanthophrys_): 5½″. A yellowish
parrotlike bird with a heavy hooked beak that formerly occurred in Kaupo
Gap at Haleakala. Last record, a few miles outside the park, was in
1950.<br>
  <i> Status Uncertain</b></i>

Game birds are sometimes released by the State Division of Fish and Game
near the park, but they do not always become established. A recent
release (June 1960) just outside the park boundary near Headquarters at
Haleakala was the Erckel’s Francolin (_Francolinus erckelii_). This
large chickenlike partridge can be recognized by its rusty-red crown. It
is not yet known whether the birds will reproduce and become
established.

 <h2>HOW THE BIRDS CAME</h2>


<p>Geologically the Hawaiian Islands are considered to be fairly young,
probably no more than 20 million years old. The islands are also
extremely isolated from any other land masses; it is more than 2,000
miles to the nearest continent. Before any resident birdlife could exist
here, plants had to become established. Seeds arrived by various means
from distant lands, and one by one new kinds of plants began to grow on
the volcanoes—at first only a few primitive types could get a foothold
on the barren lava, but in time those early plants decayed and combined
with the basalt rock to produce a soil that could support a complex
vegetation.</p>


                               <i> Endemics </i>
<p>We have no way of knowing what kind of land bird was the first to take
up residence here, for that early species has certainly been greatly
altered through the workings of evolution. In fact today nearly all the
resident native birds are types that are now found nowhere else in the
world. Birds such as these are called _endemic_; they have undergone
gradual change over the millennia to become completely new forms,
different from any birds found elsewhere.Many of Hawaii’s endemic species belong to the Hawaiian honeycreeper
family (Drepaniidae) and are thought to have evolved from a single bird
prototype that possibly arrived here from Central or South America.
Explosive bursts of evolutionary change followed, and the resulting new
forms did not much resemble each other. Present day park representatives
of the Hawaiian honeycreepers include the apapane, iiwi, and amakihi.Besides the Hawaiian honeycreeper stock several other early migrants
made their residence in Hawaii and evolved into endemic forms. In the
park they include a Hawaiian race of the (North American) short-eared
owl, the io (a hawk), the nene (a goose), the omao (a thrush), and the
elepaio (an Old World flycatcher).</p>


                         <i>Migrants and Sea Birds</i>

<p>While the endemic species have acquired full residence on the islands,
other birds live here for only part of the year, usually returning to
the north during summer to breed. In the park the best known of these
migrants is the American golden plover which spends almost 10 months of
the year in Hawaii and only 2 months on its travels to the Aleutian
Islands.Migration patterns for certain of the sea birds are virtually unknown.
Some, like the white-tailed tropic-bird, may remain near the islands
throughout the year, while others, such as the dark-rumped petrel,
migrate inland only during their breeding season.</p>


                               <i> Exotics</i>

<p>The most recent additions to Hawaii’s avifauna are birds brought in
since 1855 by man. There are various reasons for the introductions; the
mynah, for example, was brought here from India in 1865 to combat the
army worm and other insect pests. Perhaps most of the exotics were
introduced because people wanted to see birds that reminded them of
their former homes. Birds like the cardinal from the eastern United
States and the white-eye from Japan are in this category. For years the
Hui Manu, a local bird club, was active in releasing new birds on the
islands. Game birds constitute another type of introduction. The first
to arrive was the California quail more than a hundred years ago.
Pheasants and chukars among others have also become established in the
park from importations.</p>

                      <h3>THE DECLINE OF NATIVE BIRDS</h3>


<p>In no area in the world have native birds fared more poorly than in
Hawaii during the past century. The causes of the decimation of numbers
and species are probably multiple; certainly no single factor alone can
be cited. Possibly some of the most specialized forms had already begun
a decline in numbers before the arrival of Western man. It is unlikely
that feather gathering for leis as practiced by the ancient Hawaiians
had much to do with the decline. On the other hand, the clearing of
land, which began early in the 1800’s, must have had a devastating
effect on those birds that had become so specialized—they simply were
forced into new environments and were unable to adapt. The introduction
of new plants, especially grasses, and the establishment of feral
mammals (goats, sheep, and pigs), and insects played a subtle but
possibly even more destructive role in altering the over-all
environment.Introduction of exotic birds must have been the final blow to many of
the native species. Unfortunately until recently there was no adequate
control over importing and releasing new birds in Hawaii. The delicate
balance of nature was rudely upset when some of the more aggressive
exotic birds were released indiscriminately on the islands. Exotic birds
such as the white-eye became so plentiful that direct competition for
food with the natives must have occurred. Furthermore, bird diseases new
to Hawaii, such as avian malaria (probably brought to the islands with
some introduced bird from the Orient), would have been a great killer.
With a few exceptions, however, it does seem that the remaining Hawaiian
native birds are now holding their own.</p>


                        <h4> WHERE TO SEE THE BIRDS</h4>


<p>You will probably be amazed at the extremes of climate in Hawaii,
especially on Kilauea Volcano. This is one of the rare places in the
world where you can walk a few hundred yards from an area of heavy
rainfall to one of striking dryness. The change is due to prevailing
trade winds which force moisture laden clouds up over the mountain
masses from the northeast, then allow the clouds to dissipate on the
leeward side of the mountains. By taking the Crater Rim drive at
Kilauea, you will pass through lush fern jungle on one side of the
crater and barren desert on the other.Birds are very sensitive to these differences in climate. Most of the
species you find at Thurston Lava Tube will never be seen at Halemaumau,
less than 3 miles away. The same thing is true at Haleakala, although
less dramatically so. To help you locate the most rewarding sites for
bird study in the park, here are a few suggestions:</p>


                          <i> Kilauea-Mauna Loa</i>

<p>_Thurston Lava Tube._ This is the heart of Hawaii’s tree-fern jungle and
an excellent habitat for several native species, such as the apapane,
iiwi, and amakihi. Spend a few moments looking for these at the exhibit
overlook, then take the quarter-mile loop path that leads through the
lava tube. On the other side of the lava tube parking area a trail
descends into Kilauea Iki, the site of the 1959 eruption. This
delightful walk also passes through fern jungle. Be on the lookout for
the io (Hawaiian hawk) in Kilauea Iki.</p>

   <cite> [Illustration: _Grass slopes on the Mauna Loa Strip_]</cite>

<p>_Halemaumau._ A most unlikely place for birds; however, there are almost
always a few white-tailed tropic-birds soaring within the pit._Kipuka Puaulu._ A popular name for this area is “Bird Park” and for
good reason, for this kipuka, a hundred acre island of well developed
vegetation surrounded by a recent lava flow, harbors 11 or more species.
The commonest here are the white-eye, red-billed leiothrix, and house
finch—all exotics. When the ohia trees are in bloom, and usually there
are at least a few, large numbers of iiwis and apapanes are attracted to
the kipuka. Other interesting birds often seen here are the elepaio,
Japanese blue pheasant, and cardinal._Mauna Loa Strip._ More kinds of birds (18) have been recorded from the
koa parkland along the Mauna Loa Strip road than from any other locality
in the park, but you are not likely to see large numbers in any one
place along the strip. The road ascends the lower slopes of Mauna Loa
from 4,000 feet at Kipuka Puaulu to 6,663 feet. Several introduced game
birds—Japanese blue pheasant, California quail, and chukar—may be
flushed as you drive up the road. Skylarks and house finches are fairly
common along the grassy flats, and you are almost sure to see an amakihi
in the koa grove at the end of the road. If you are lucky you might be
rewarded with a glimpse of a nene somewhere on these upper slopes.</p>


                             <i>  Haleakala</i>

<p>_Hosmer Grove and Paliku._ These two localities are about the only
densely wooded areas in Haleakala National Park and both attract a
variety of birdlife. The apapane, iiwi, and amakihi as well as several
exotic birds can be seen at either place. A delightful self-guiding
nature trail that identifies many of the plants and trees winds through
the Hosmer Grove._Road to Haleakala Summit._ As you drive up to the Observatory from Park
Headquarters you will probably be surprised at the number of ring-necked
pheasants and chukars that flush along the road. Golden plovers and
skylarks are also plentiful, and mockingbirds may be seen occasionally.</p>

<p><strong>  THE NATIONAL PARKS </strong></p>
<p>Hawaii Volcanoes National Park and Haleakala National Park are two of
more than 180 different areas administered by the National Park Service
for your enjoyment. The two areas, Haleakala on Maui and Kilauea-Mauna
Loa on Hawaii, were set aside, as one park, by Congress in 1916 mainly
because of the three great volcanoes. In July 1961 Haleakala became a
separate national park. In recent years the unique flora and fauna found
in the parks have become an increasingly important part of the park
story. Thus you will find several interesting exhibits at the Kilauea
headquarters museum dealing with the ecology of the park with emphasis
on the birdlife.</p>

<p>One of the guiding principles for any national park is that all native
species of plants and animals are rigidly protected. In places like
Hawaii, where so much of the land has been altered through clearing and
planting, the park becomes a particularly important sanctuary for birds
and other animals. Please help do your share in protecting this area by
observing park regulation</p>
