       <div class="header">DARK-RUMPED PETREL _Pterodroma phaeopygia_
                          <b>(Hawaiian name—uau)</b></div>
<img src="bird1.jpg" alt="This Is the Hawaii logo" width=180 height=180>
<i>DESCRIPTION</i> 15″. Underparts, forehead, and cheeks, white; back, upper
wings, and upper tail, dark. The crown is black.

<i>PARK DISTRIBUTION</i>
<p> This petrel is a sea bird that nests in the mountains
of the Hawaiian group; it is the nesting birds that may be seen or heard
within the park between May and November. Kilauea—Status unknown; the
cliffs of Kilauea Crater may be used for nesting. Haleakala—Many birds
nest in the walls of the crater. The cliffs behind Kapalaoa and Holua
Cabins are the best places to hear them at night.</p>

<i>VOICE</i>
<p> As the birds fly overhead seeking their burrows after dusk, the
air is filled with their strange calls, some of which sound like the
barking of a small dog. A common pattern of notes is _oooo-wéh, ooo-wéh,
oo-wéh, oo-wéh_, etc., with the first notes drawn out and the last run
together in rapid succession.</p>


<p>Dark-rumped Petrels spend most of their life at sea, but in April and
May they begin their nightly flights inland to burrows they have
established high on the cliffs of Hawaiian volcanoes. A single egg is
laid near the end of the horizontal cavity that may be more than 6 feet
deep in the rocks. For the next 6 months the adults will fly in from the
ocean each night to tend the nest, arriving about an hour after sundown.
It is while they are circling in search of the burrows that you can hear
their mysterious barking sounds. The calling may continue for 2 hours or
more. Imagine the problems that each petrel must face trying to find its
own burrow 20 miles from the ocean on a foggy, moonless night—perhaps
the continuous calling back and forth helps orient it. The adults return
to the ocean before sunrise.</p>

<p>In the early days nesting birds were common on all the main Hawaiian
Islands; however, for a time it was feared that they were becoming
extinct. Hawaiians used to dig out the downy young petrels for food, and
introduced mongooses and cats also took a heavy toll, especially where
nests were at lower elevations. Now, with known breeding colonies high
on Haleakala and Mauna Kea and probably on Mauna Loa and Kilauea, the
future of this interesting species seems assured.</p>

                          <b>(Hawaiian name—koae)</b></div>
<img src="bird2.jpg" alt="This Is the Hawaii logo" width=180 height=180>

<i>DESCRIPTION</i>
<p> 30″-32″. Unmistakable as a large white bird with two
fantastically long tail plumes, soaring around rocky cliffs such as in
Halemaumau. There is some black on the upper wings and around the face.</p>

<i>PARK DISTRIBUTION</i>
<p> Kilauea—Uncommon, except locally. There are nearly
always a few birds soaring in Halemaumau, around the pit craters in the
Kau Desert, and near Hilina Pali. They are occasionally seen along the
coast. Haleakala—Some can usually be seen in the crater, especially
around the ruggedest cliffs such as behind Holua and Paliku Cabins.</p>

<i>VOICE</i>
<p> High pitched rasping cries.</p>


<p>Halemaumau—What a strange place for a sea bird! Yet these fish-eating
birds have nested in the Kilauea area for as long as we have records. In
recent years Halemaumau has been their favorite haunt, except when
volcano fumes drive them away, such as during the time when heavy
sulphur gasses filled the pit in June 1960. When Halemaumau erupts the
birds may become trapped by rapidly rising hot gas; in 1952 several of
them perished, falling into the molten lava below. For a meal the
Halemaumau birds must make at least a 10-mile flight to the ocean.</p>

                    <div class="header">   NENE _Branta sandvicensis_
                         <b>(also Hawaiian goose)</b></div>
<img src="bird3.jpg" alt="This Is the Hawaii logo" width=180 height=180>

<i>DESCRIPTION</i>
<p> 23″-28″. The only ducklike bird apt to be seen in the park.
A medium sized goose with striking head and neck markings. The face,
crown, and top of the neck are black, the throat and neck sides are
cream colored, and the remainder of the body is mottled and dark.</p>

<i>PARK DISTRIBUTION</i>
<p> Formerly abundant in Hawaii and probably Maui. Now
extinct on Maui, while a few wild birds remain on Hawaii.
Kilauea—Occasionally seen on the slopes of Mauna Loa usually between
6,000 and 7,500 feet.</p>

<i>VOICE</i>
<p> Various thin, creaky notes. Often gives a high-pitched honking in
flight.</p>


<p>Because of recent studies, the habits of the nene are probably better
understood than those of any other native Hawaiian bird. The most
amazing thing about their life is the way they have forsaken water in
favor of rough, clinkery lava. All other ducks and geese rear their
young partly in water, but today the breeding grounds for the nene, high
on the barren slopes of Mauna Loa, are far from the nearest open water.
Here during the winter months the geese raise their broods of two to
five young. Berries, herbs, and grass growing in kipukas (islands of
vegetation surrounded by more recent lava flows) comprise the diet. At
present the nene is one of the rarest birds in the world and has been
near extinction in recent years.</p>

<p>The story of the nene’s decline is a sad one but it may yet have a happy
ending. Early visitors to the islands described the large flocks of nene
geese in the interior of Hawaii, but by 1900 a great decline in numbers
had occurred and in 1940 the entire population was estimated at 30 to 50
wild birds. Clearing of the land, introduction of such exotic mammals as
rats, pigs, dogs, and mongooses, and man himself through hunting—all
must share the blame for the nene decimation. Happily, the State of
Hawaii has taken vigorous recognition of this situation and a
restoration program was begun in 1949. The plan is to study the
remaining wild birds to learn how the decimating factors may be
controlled. Also nene raised in captivity have been released on Mauna
Loa to intermix with the wild flocks, and it is hoped that some day
visitors to Hawaii will again be assured of seeing these wonderful
geese.</p>

                      <div class="header">   IO _Buteo solitarius_
                          <b>(also Hawaiian hawk)</b></div>
<img src="bird4.jpg" alt="This Is the Hawaii logo" width=180 height=180>

<i>DESCRIPTION</i>
<p> 16″-18″. The only hawklike bird to be seen on the islands,
except for accidental migrants. This small _Buteo_ has both light and
dark color phases. Can be distinguished from the Pueo, Hawaii’s diurnal
owl, by a smaller head and more soaring flight.</p>

<i>PARK DISTRIBUTION</i>
<p> Found only on the island of Hawaii.
Kilauea—Occasional throughout the park. Individuals are often seen
soaring around the forested craters such as Kilauea Iki and Makaopuhi,
or in the more open areas such as along the Mauna Loa Strip road.</p>

<i>VOICE</i>
<p> A medium-pitched, but fairly soft, scream.<p>


<p>The io is certainly one of the rarest hawks in the world, as its range
is limited to the island of Hawaii, and even here it is not common. It
feeds on rats, mice, and large insects and spiders, and occasionally
will catch birds, but today birds comprise a minor part of the diet. It
tends to be tamer than mainland hawks, perhaps because it has not been
harassed as much in recent years, and sometimes you can approach a
perched io quite closely. Because of its rodent diet, the io is a very
beneficial bird to Hawaii.</p>

   <cite> [Illustration: _California quail (male and female)_]</cite>

</div><div class="bird">
              <div class="header"> CALIFORNIA QUAIL _Lophortyx californicus_</div>
<img src="bird5.jpg" alt="This Is the Hawaii logo" width=180 height=180>
<i>DESCRIPTION</i>
<p> 9½″-10½″. The distinctive _curved head plume_ identifies
this plump quail. Males have a black and white face pattern beneath the
brown crown, while females are duller and lack the striking facial
pattern. The bill is short and black.</p>

<i>PARK DISTRIBUTION</i>
<p> Introduced from California before 1855 to all major
islands. Kilauea—Moderately common along the Mauna Loa Strip and south
and west of Kilauea Crater, for example Kipuka Nene. Haleakala—Fairly
common on slopes outside the crater up to about 8,000 feet.</p>

<i>VOICE</i>
<p> Both sexes issue a three noted _ka-kér-ko_, also clucking notes
_tek-tek_, etc.</p>


<p>Although the California quail has been in the islands for a long time,
it has not spread much in the park, probably because there is no
available open water. In this situation the birds must rely on dewfall,
berries, or succulent vegetation for their moisture requirements. They
shun heavy forests and do best where small grassy openings are
interspersed with dense brush thickets.</p>

                      <div class="header"> CHUKAR _Alectoris graeca_</div>
<img src="bird6.jpg" alt="This Is the Hawaii logo" width=180 height=180>
<i>DESCRIPTION</i>
<p> 15″. A heavy ground dwelling partridge, brownish with
buffy, black, and rusty markings. A black band extends through each eye
and joins the lower throat. Distinguished from the quail by lighter
color, lack of a head plume, and a red-orange bill.</p>

   <cite> [Illustration: _Chukar_]</cite>

<i>PARK DISTRIBUTION</i>
<p> Introduced on Hawaii in 1949, on Maui in 1953.
Kilauea—Occasional on the slopes of Mauna Loa, descending as far as the
rim of Kilauea Crater. Haleakala—Common in open lava slopes inside and
out of the crater but especially along the drive to the summit.</p>

<i>VOICE</i>
<p> Chickenlike cackles and clucks, sometimes quite loud.</p>


<p>They are well camouflaged to blend with Hawaii’s gray lava and are not
usually seen until one or more flushes from an open or even bare slope.
Then they will fly downslope, sometimes for hundreds of yards, land, and
again merge invisibly with the somber background.</p>

<p>During the breeding season in late spring and summer the birds pair up;
at other times of the year you may encounter coveys of a dozen or more.</p>

         <div class="header"> RING-NECKED PHEASANT _Phasianus colchicus torquatus_
                        <b>(also Chinese pheasant)</b></div>
<img src="bird7.jpg" alt="This Is the Hawaii logo" width=180 height=180>
<i>DESCRIPTION</i>
<p> Male 33″-36″; female 20″. _Male_: A rich chestnut-brown
bird with a conspicuous _white collar_ at the base of a dark green neck,
and an extremely long pointed tail. Hybridizes freely with the Japanese
blue pheasant, producing various combinations of ring-necked and blue
plumage. _Female_: Dull brown with a shorter tail than the male, similar
to the Japanese blue hen.</p>

   <cite> [Illustration: _Ring-necked pheasant cock_]</cite><br>

<i>PARK DISTRIBUTION</i> 
<p>Introduced from China about 1865, now widely
distributed on all main islands. Kilauea—Pure ring-necks are quite rare
but Japanese blue hybrids are not uncommon in grassy openings,
especially along the Mauna Loa Strip road. Haleakala—One of the most
common birds of the park, both inside and out of the crater.</p>

<i>VOICE</i>
<p> The cocks crow throughout the breeding season (January-July) with
a violent staccato _koor-káck_.</p>


<p>Optimum pheasant habitat is large open grassy areas interspersed with
brush cover, and since this condition prevails on the slopes of
Haleakala and along the Mauna Loa Strip road, these birds are found in
both sections of the park. Your first view of one will likely be when it
flushes out with a great flurry of wingbeats alongside a road or trail
in these grasslands. Family broods with as many as 10 chicks may be seen
from April through August.</p>

                      <div class="header">MYNAH _Acridotheres tristis_</div>
<img src="bird8.jpg" alt="This Is the Hawaii logo" width=180 height=180>
    <cite>[Illustration: MYNAH]</cite>

DESCRIPTION: 9″. No other bird like it. Black, brown, and white with
yellow bill, feet, and skin around the eye; above all noisy. Large white
wing patches are conspicuous in flight.

PARK DISTRIBUTION: Introduced from India in 1865. Kilauea—Common at Park
Headquarters, around other human habitations, and to the south
especially around Hilina Pali. Occasional in the Kau Desert. Haleakala—A
few live around the Park Headquarters area in the summer months but they
descend to lower elevations in winter.

VOICE: A raucous mixture of squawks, mews, and chirrs not likely to be
mistaken for any other bird.


For a bird that prefers to live around human habitations, the mynah is
extremely wary of people—probably with good reason, for among the
imported birds the mynah has never been particularly well loved. Yet it
is at least partly beneficial since it often feeds on agricultural
insect pests. “Mynah bird” has become a favorite Hawaiian expression for
anyone who chatters endlessly.
