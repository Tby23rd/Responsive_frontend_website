  <h1>ABOUT THIS WEBSITE</h1>


<p>The purpose of this website is to help anyone who cares to learn about
the birdlife of the national parks in Hawaii. Many of you, here in
Hawaii for the first time, will not recognize most of our birds;
however, the species are so few (32 described here) that it will not be
too hard to narrow your identification to the correct one. The little
perching birds are likely to give the most trouble, and the commonest of
these are shown on the color plate. You will probably want to refer to
the plate first when identifying a small bird. Descriptions in the text
refer to similar species also, so if you see a bird that appears
somewhat, but not exactly, like one of the illustrations, look up the
illustrated species in the text for clues.</p>

<p>Hawaiian names, when known, are used as the common name for each bird,
except for species that range elsewhere (e.g., all the sea birds and
introduced birds). The _A.O.U. Checklist of North American Birds_ has
been used as the authority of nomenclature wherever applicable,
otherwise the _Checklist and Summary of Hawaiian Birds_ by E. H. Bryan,
Jr., has been followed. For every description, length from the tip of
the bill to the end of the tail is given in inches. The stated
distributions are for the park only and they emphasize accessible places
that you are most likely to visit.</p>
